This is a sample project named ToDo project written with laravel 12. In this project, there are some tasks and different categories. Each category has multiple tasks and each task can have one category.  We have CRUD operations in this project. In other words, we can create, read, update, and delete tasks and categories. In addition to title and content, we can add image to each task. In this project, the validation of values while creating or editing is also done.  When deleting a category, all the related tasks are also removed. Pagination has also been done.

In order to run the project, after downloading the project:
1. php artisan migrate => to transfer the tables to database
2. php artisan db:seed (optional) => to create the default categories to be able to create tasks

The project will run as supposed to.
